# Moneta

Moneta is an aggregation of vital information about a stock that a potential investor would want to know. It displays a graphical view of the stock price over time along with sentiment reports of recent news and tweets about the stock. Sentiment analysis is the process of using AI to analyze data and gauge the emotion behind it as positive, neutral or negative. Vader is the sentiment analysis tool used for this project. It also charts out the top investors and mutual funds invested in the particular stock. The data for this website is provided by a flask API that I created in Python and Flask. The front end of the project is built in React.js with material-ui styling
